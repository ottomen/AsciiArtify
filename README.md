# DevOps course | Week 4/Task 5

A pilot version of "AsciiArtify" is already under development.

The team agreed with your arguments and invited you to prepare a Proof of Concept (PoC) for deploying the GitOps system on the Kubernetes variant you recommended. The team proposed the ArgoCD product.

PoC is the stage where the developers check whether it is technically possible to implement the product concept. At this stage, developers use a minimal set of features to demonstrate that the product can work and perform its core functions.

You need to practically deploy a Kubernetes cluster using the tool approved at the Concept stage. Install the system and configure command access to the ArgoCD GUI.

Basic steps for preparing and deploying ArgoCD on Kubernetes can be found in the Coding Session.

The result of the task will be an installed and configured ArgoCD system, ready for MVP implementation.

The answer to the task will be a link to the AsciiArtify repository with demo instructions for accessing the ArgoCD interface. Doc/POC.md file in Markdown format, main branch (Demo example from the official site â€” https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
